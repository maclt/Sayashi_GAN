# Sayashi_GAN

GAN to generate the face of the idle of "Hello ! Project".
I love "Hello ! Project", which is Japanese idel group.

This repositpry contains 4 .ipynb files.
With "get_sayashi.ipynb", "get_sayumiipynb" and "get_karin.ipynb", we can get photos of idles' faces from AmebaBlog.
Sayashi_GAN.ipynb is to generate the faces with GAN, but the generated faces are so ambiguas that I need improvement.
